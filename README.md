# [JSL01] Submission: Syntax-Engine Interaction Project

This Syntax-Engine Interaction Project is about a virtual pet adoption website that will check if the user has entered a valid pet adoption detail.

I created a JavaScript function called validSyntax that takes a string as an input and validates if it matches the specific syntax specified.
The variable name called result is where I set the specific syntax value to be “pet_2105Forrest”.
I added two if statement that will take the user input and validate if it matches the specific syntax.
If the input value is correct the user will receive an “Valid Syntax” message, otherwise the user will receive an “Invalid Syntax” message.
